# Exit Animations
 
## Better animation on conditional render

Click on the two examples, the check mark on the left only animates when it scales up. 
<AnimatePresenceBasic />

<br/>
The reason is React will completely remove and add elements from the DOM by using conditional rendering. We add `initial={{ scale: 0 }}` and `animate={{ scale: 1 }}`, so React knows what to do when element is created in the DOM, but has no clue what to do when it is removed.

```js
export function Example() {
    const [isChecked, setIsChecked] = useState(true);
    return (
        <motion.div
            whileTap={{ scale: 0.95 }}
            onTap={() => setIsChecked(!isChecked)}
        >
            {isChecked && (
                <motion.svg
                    width={60}
                    height={60}
                    viewBox="0 0 60 60"
                    fill="none"
                    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
                    animate={{ scale: 1 }}
                    initial={{ scale: 0 }}
                >
                    <path
                        d="M50 15L22.5 42.5L10 30"
                        stroke="var(--color-text-100)"
                        strokeWidth={8}
                        strokeLinecap="round"
                        strokeLinejoin="round"
                    />
                </motion.svg>
            )}
        </motion.div>
    );
} 
```
We use `exit` to tell React to how to animate when exiting and wrap it in `<AnimatePresence>`. Now the check mark is exiting with animation.
```js
<AnimatePresence>
    {isChecked && (
        <motion.svg
            animate={{ scale: 1, opacity: 1 }}
            initial={{ scale: 0, opacity: 0 }}
            exit={{ scale: 0, opacity: 0 }}
        >
            <path />
        </motion.svg>
    )}
</AnimatePresence>
```

## Multiple children
You can wrap more elements in an `<AnimatePresence>`, and they will all animate when added or removed, as long as they have a `key` property.
<MultiChildren />

The animation part is the same as we talked before, since it is a `map` function, it definitely needs `key`.
```js
<AnimatePresence>
    {range(items).map((item) => (
        <motion.div
            className={styles.item}
            key={item}
            style={{
                backgroundColor:
                    item > 8
                        ? 'var(--color-accent-red)'
                        : item < 9 && item > 6
                        ? 'var(--color-accent-yellow)'
                        : 'var(--color-accent-green)',
                originY: 1,
            }}
            initial={{ scaleY: 0 }}
            animate={{ scaleY: 1 }}
            exit={{ scaleY: 0 }}
        ></motion.div>
    ))}
</AnimatePresence>
```

In the button click parent, every time clicking '+' button changes total `items` number, so it will trigger re-WebGL2RenderingContext. Because of the `key`, `<AnimatePresence>` knows which one to animate in or out.

For colored bar scale from bottom effect, it is initially set `orginY` to `1`, when `scaleY:1` it will scale from bottom.
```js
const maxItems = 10
const [items, setItems] = React.useState(5)
function handlePlus() {
    if (items < maxItems) {
        setItems(items + 1)
    } else {
        setItems(maxItems)
    }
}
```


## Same `p` with different `key`
Take a look at green L when you click buttons. On the left it will not animate. The reason is this:
<KeyDiff />
```js
const items = ['B', 'E', 'L', 'L']
const [selected, setSelected] = React.useState(0)
<motion.p
    key={items[selected]}
    initial={{ scale: 0, rotate: -180 }}
    animate={{ scale: 1, rotate: 0 }}
    exit={{ scale: 0, rotate: -180 }}
    style={{ color: colors[selected] }}
>
    {items[selected]}
</motion.p>
```
The `key={items[selected]}` for both L are the sample, that is why it won't animate on the second L. 

## What happens when mount and unmount an element
How the DOM is replacing the element wrapped in `<AnimatePresence>`? It turns out to be very simple. It will make a copy of that element css styles. 

On the top example, it has `absolute` position, when the new element added to the DOM, it will take exact position(in the center of the box), and the old and new element animates at the same postion.

On the bottom example, the wrapper has `display: flex`, the new element added will take next available space in the wrapper. The old and new element animates from different postions.
<MountEleInCloseUp />

## `mode` options
What if we don't want mounting new element mount and unmounting old element at the same time?
We have 3 mode options, `sync`, `wait` and `popLayout`.

<ModeWait />

`sync` is the default value which takes effect immediately. 

`wait` will finish the exit animation before starting the new animation.

`popLayout` exiting elements will be popped from the page layout, allowing surrounding elements to animate into place immediately.
<ModeCompare />

<br/>
In the example above, the secret sauce of animating surounding element into place is `layout` keyword.

```js
<motion.div
    layout
    key={item}
    className={styles.item}
    initial={{ scale: 0 }}
    animate={{ scale: 1 }}
    exit={{ scale: 0 }}
    onClick={() => handleClick(item)}
></motion.div>
```

## `onExitComplete`
This callback event will run when an exit animation has finished. You can use it to make something happen when an element finished animating out.

The button will be `setOpacity(0)` when cliked and when `<AnimatePresence>` is finished, it will be `setOpacity(1)`. 

```js
<AnimatePresence
    onExitComplete={() => {
        setOpacity(1)
        setDisabled(false)
    }}
>
```
<OnExitComplete />

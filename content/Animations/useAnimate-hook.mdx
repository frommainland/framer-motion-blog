# `useAnimate`
 
## Basic
With `useAnimate()`, you can manually start and stop animations and create a sequence of different animations. This new hook will soon replace `useAnimationControls()` because this one works with all HTML and SVG elements, not only Motion elements.


### Return after drag
Here’s an example of a draggable div that will always return to its initial state. It animates back to its start position of `{ x: 0, y: 0 }` two seconds after you stop dragging.
<UseAnimateBasic />

```js
export function Example() {
    const [scope, animate] = useAnimate()

    let timer = React.useRef(null)

    return (
        <motion.div
            ref={scope}
            className={styles.item}
            whileTap={{ scale: 0.9 }}
            drag
            dragConstraints={dragConstaintRef}
            onDragEnd={() => {
                timer = setTimeout(
                    () =>
                        animate(
                            scope.current,
                            { x: 0, y: 0 },
                            { type: 'spring', duration: 0.8, bounce: 0.5 }
                        ),
                    600
                )
            }}
            onDragStart={() => clearTimeout(timer)}
        ></motion.div>
    )
} 
```

### How to use useAnimate
This `useAnimate()` hook is actually a wrapper around the `animate()` function we also use to animate Motion values. It’s a hook, so you call it at the beginning of your component, and it returns two things:

- A scope, a reference (as those created by `useRef()`) that you pass to the element you want to animate,
- animate() function to start animations with.

The animate() function takes three arguments:

- The element you want to animate, either as:
    - A direct link to the element itself — Here, it is scope.current (with current because this is a reference).
    - Sub-elements inside the element.
- The values you want to animate in the same type of `{object}` that you would pass to an animate property.
- And an optional `{object}` with transition settings, as you would pass them to the transition property.

### Animate sub-elements
You can animate the element you attached the reference (scope) to, but you can also animate elements it contains.

<SubElementUseAnimate />

```js 
// animate yellow border
animate(
    'section',
    { borderColor: 'var(--color-surface-200)' },
    transition
)

//animate dark background
animate(
    bgRef.current,
    { backgroundColor: 'var(--color-surface-200)' },
    transition
)
animate(
    `div.${styles.bg}`,
    { backgroundColor: 'var(--color-surface-200)' },
    transition
)

//animate svg path
animate('path', { pathLength: 0 }, transition)
```

There are 3 ways of selecting the child element inside the reference (scope)

- for html tags, `'div'` `'section'`
- for  css class names, `'div.myClass'`. I use css module, so it would be `div.${styles.myClass}` You have to write the html tag at the beginning.
- create a new ref, similar like `scope`

### Animate when appearing
When you want to animate something the moment it appears, you’ll have to put it in a `useEffect()` because the reference (scope) to the element will otherwise be empty.

```js
useEffect(() => {
    animate1(
        scope1.current,
        { x: [0, 200, 200, 0, 0], rotate: [0, 0, 360, 360, 0] },
        { duration: 4 }
    );
}, []);
```

## Controls
To control an animation, you save what’s returned by animate() in a variable and then call commands like `play()`,` pause()`, `cancel()`, `complete()`, and `stop()` on that variable.

- `pause()` — Pauses an animation.
- `play()` — Resumes it from the point where you left it.
- `cancel()` — Stops the animation and returns the element to its initial state.
- `complete()` — Immediately completes the animation.
- `stop()` — <span style={{color: 'var(--color-accent-red)'}}>Stops the animation completely; without the option to play() it again.</span>
- `speed` — set animation speed 

```
// Normal speed
animation.speed = 1

// Half speed
animation.speed = 0.5

// Double speed
animation.speed = 2

// Reverse
animation.speed = -1
```

<UseAnimateControl />

## Why useAnimate
Check the example below, this looks like a keyframe animation. It is imperative and if you use keyframe to do it, it will be messy and hard to read.
<WhyuseAnimate />
```js 
React.useEffect(() => {
    const animateEle = async () => {
        await animate(
            scope.current,
            { x: width - 120 - 32 - 32 },
            { duration: 2 }
        )
        await animate(scope.current, { y: 50 })
        await animate(scope.current, {
            backgroundColor: 'var(--color-accent-blue)',
            borderRadius: 0,
            scale: 0.45,
        })
        // insert a delay
        await animate(scope.current, { y: 50.1 }, { duration: 1 })
        await animate(scope.current, { x: 0, rotate: 360 })
        await animate(scope.current, {
            y: 0,
            backgroundColor: 'var(--color-surface-200)',
            borderRadius: '2em',
            scale: 1,
        })
    }
    animateEle()
}, [])
```
Instead of using keyframe, you can control the flow in a readable manner in useAnimate, with all capability of keyframes.

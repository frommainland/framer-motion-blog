# Variants
You’ll often want to animate interface elements between a few different visual states. A button might have a different color when pressed down or be temporarily grayed out when disabled. With Framer Motion’s variants, you can give these animation states recognizable names like, e.g., "pressed" or "disabled".

## Basic use
Usually, you pass animate an object with properties to animate to, something like `{ rotate: 180 }`. With variants, you give those animation states a name, a variant label, and tell animate (or whileHover, whileTap…) to animate to that label.

You describe these visual states in an object (here simply called variants):

… which you pass to the element’s variants property, so it knows that "start", for example, stands for `{ rotate: 180 }`.

```js
export function Example() {

    const variants = {
    start: { rotate: 180 },
    hoverState: { borderRadius: "75px" },
    tapState: { backgroundColor: "#ffd700" },
    }

    return (
        <motion.div
            variants={variants}
            animate="start"
            whileHover="hoverState"
            whileTap="tapState"
        />
    );
}
```

You can now animate to "start" instead of having to write `{{ rotate: 180 }}`.


## Animation propagation
It gets even better when your element has children. When you give a child a set of variants with the same labels, it will also animate, automatically.

Here the parent div has a set of variants used in its animate, whileHover and whileTap animations.

```js
export function Example() {
    const childVariants = {
        start: { rotate: -180 },
        hoverState: { borderRadius: "30px" },
        tapState: { backgroundColor: "#f00" }
    };

    return (
        <motion.div
            variants={{
                start: { rotate: 180, borderRadius: "30px" },
                hoverState: { borderRadius: "75px" },
                tapState: { backgroundColor: "#ffd700" }
            }}
            animate="start"
            whileHover="hoverState"
            whileTap="tapState"
        >
            <motion.div variants={childVariants} />
        </motion.div>
    );
} 
```

And to the child div you only have pass its set of childVariants and it will follow along.

The animate, whileHover, and whileTap properties are only set on the parent; all the child needs is a set of (identically named) variants for this to work.

The parent’s "start" animation is a rotate to 180, but the child rotates to -180. Because of the child’s counterclockwise rotation, it doesn’t seem to rotate at all.

## Animation orchestration

You can orchestrate child animations by adding these settings to the parent’s transition object:

- with `delayChildren`, you insert a delay between the parent and child animations;
- with `staggerChildren`, you add delays between the children animations themselves;
- with `staggerDirection`, you decide which child to start with;
- and with `when`, you can have the parent animate after the children. 

### `staggerChildren` and `delayChildren`

The animation will start after 0.2s, since the `delayChildren: 0.2`. `staggerChildren: 0.1` will trigger he first child immediately, the second child will start after 0.1s, the third will start after 0.2s and so forth. 

Notice in the parent there is no real value for `initial="initial"` and `animate="animate"` and it still works.

```js
export default function StaggerChildAndDelayChildren() {
	// ...omit irrelevant codes

	const childVariants = {
		initial: { y: textWrapHeight },
		animate: { y: 0 },
	}

	return (
        <div className={styles.wrap}>
            <motion.div
                initial="initial"
                animate="animate"
                transition={{
                    delayChildren: 0.2,
                    staggerChildren: 0.1,
                }}
            >
                {textArray.map((item, index) => (
                    <motion.span
                        key={index}
                        variants={childVariants}
                        transition={{
                            duration: 0.5,
                            ease: smooth,
                        }}
                    >
                        {item}
                    </motion.span>
                ))}
            </motion.div>
        </div>
	)
}
```
<StaggerChildAndDelayChildren />


### `staggerDirection` and `when`
What if we want the staggerChildren to start backwards? `staggerDirection: -1` will do it. `staggerDirection` accepts both `1` and `-1` and it represents the direction.

`when` takes two values: "beforeChildren" to finish this transition before starting children transitions, "afterChildren" to finish children transitions before starting this transition.
<StaggerDirectionAndWhen />

### Dynamic Variants
A variant label typically contains an object, but it can also contain a function that returns an object. This way, you can create dynamic variants.

```js
const child = {
    initial: () => ({
        rotate: Math.floor(Math.random() * 360),
    }),
    animate: {rotate: 0}
}
```
This code will work in CSR, what should we do in SSR?
```js
const [child, setChild] = React.useState(null)

React.useEffect(() => {
    setChild({
        initial: { rotate: Math.floor(Math.random() * 360) },
        animate: { rotate: 0 },
    })
}, [])

<motion.div
    variants={child}
    initial="initial"
    animate="animate"
    // set a key, so child obj could be refresh again in nextjs, i guess
    key={child}
></motion.div>
```
<DynamicVariants />


### `custom`
Elements can have a `custom` property, whose value will be passed to the dynamic variants. 

While it could be easier if you pass props to the component instead of using `custom` property.
```js
const Item = ({ customNums }) => {
	const child = {
		initial: { scale: 0 },
		animate: (custom) => ({
			scale: custom >= 1 
            ? 1 : custom >= 0.5 && custom < 1 
            ? 0.5 : 0.2,
			transition: {
				delay: custom,
				duration: 1,
				type: 'spring',
				bounce: 0.6,
			},
		}),
	}

	return (
		<motion.div
			custom={customNums}
			className={styles.item}
			style={{ width: itemSize }}
			variants={child}
			initial="initial"
			animate="animate"
		></motion.div>
	)
}
```

```js
export default function CustomProps() {
	const customNums = [0.5, 0.2, 0.5, 0.2, 1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.2, 0.5]
	return (
        <div>
            <motion.div
                initial="initial"
                animate="animate"
            >
                {range(quantity).map((row) =>
                    range(quantity).map((column) => {
                        const index = row * quantity + column
                        return (
                            <Item
                                key={column}
                                customNums={customNums[index]}
                            />
                        )
                    })
                )}
            </motion.div>
        </div>
	)
}
```
<CustomProps />

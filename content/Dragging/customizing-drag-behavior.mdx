# Customizing Drag Behavior

## Drag Elastic

When you drag an element beyond its `dragConstraints`, it’ll move slower. There’s a resistance signaling it will bounce back, and with the `dragElastic` property, you can change its strength.

It’s a simple distance multiplier. For example, with a `dragElastic` of `0.5`, the element will move only half the distance you drag it. When set to `0.25`, it will only move a quarter, and when set to `1`, there’s no resistance at all.
```js
<motion.div
    drag
    dragElastic={0.2}
/>
```

<DragElastic />

## Drag Momentum

Interacting with a draggable element feels natural because it has some simulated physics. For instance: when you throw it, it will keep moving with a momentum animation.

You can disable this animation by setting `dragMomentum` to `false`.
<DragMomentum />
```js
<motion.div
    drag
    dragMomentum={false}
/>
```

## Drag Transition - move within constraints
What if you want to tweak the `dragMomentum` instead of turn it off? Use `dragTransition`.

The momentum animation takes the current speed (a.k.a. velocity) of the element and decelerates it at a rate that feels natural. The harder you throw it, the farther it will move. You can tweak the rate of deceleration with two settings: `power` and `timeConstant`.

### power

The docs say: “A higher power value equals a further target.” So, the higher the value, the farther you can throw the div.

The default `power` is `0.8`; changing it to something like `0.1` makes the element feel heavier, make it `2` feels lighter.

<DragTransitionPower />
```js
<motion.div
    drag
    dragTransition={{ power: 0.8 }}
/>
```

### Time constant

With `timeConstant`, you change the duration of the deceleration. The higher this value (the default is 700), the longer the animation will last.

<DragTransitionTimeConstant />
```js
<motion.div
    drag
    dragTransition={{ timeConstant: 700 }}
/>
```

## Drag Transition - snap to constraints

This spring animation only kicks in when you’ve thrown the element hard enough for the momentum animation’s endpoint to be on the other side of the constraints. And it’s also the bounce-back animation that happens when you drag an element beyond its constraints and then release it.

Two settings change the feel of this animation: `bounceStiffness` and `bounceDamping`.

### Bounce stiffness

This one is comparable to the stiffness setting of a spring animation. You could say that it’s the strength of the spring that pulls the element towards the constraint.

<DragTransitionBounceStiffness />
```js
<motion.div
    drag
    dragTransition={{ bounceStiffness: 50 }}
/>
```

### Bounce damping
This one is like a spring animation’s damping and also has the same default: `10`. Lowering it will make the animation bouncier.

<DragTransitionBounceDamping />

```js
<motion.div
    drag
    dragTransition={{ bounceDamping: 10 }}
/>
```


## ModifyTarget

As you know, a momentum animation kicks off when you release a draggable element. This animation starts with the element’s current velocity and gradually slows it down until a complete standstill.

This means that this animation’s endpoint is already known when it starts. But you can modify this target endpoint by giving `modifyTarget()` a callback function. Your function will receive the current target as a parameter, and you can return a corrected, desired position.

<DragModifyTarget />

You won’t see a big difference when you throw the div, but try to just place it somewhere; it’ll move an extra 40 points to the right and downwards.

```js
<motion.div
    drag
    dragConstraints={constraintsRef}
    dragTransition={{
        timeConstant: 300,
        modifyTarget: (target) => target + 40,
    }}
/>
```

So yes, the function is actually called twice: once for `x` and once for `y`. But, unfortunately, there’s no way of telling for which axis it was called.

### Target to 0
Let’s try something else. What would happen when we always return `0` as the new target:

<DragModifyTarget02 />

```js
dragTransition={{
    timeConstant: 300,
    modifyTarget: (target) => 0,
}}
```

The div will return to its initial position. But when you drag it over the constraints, it will only move back to the constraints. That’s because `modifyTarget()` only alters the momentum animation and not the snap to constraints animation.


### Exampel Snap To Grid

Let’s try to make a draggable motion div always snap to one of the intersections of a grid.

When you release a draggable element, a decelerating momentum animation starts. We can change—modify—the endpoint of that animation with `modifyTarget()` and direct it to one of a grid’s intersection points.

The grid below is 80 by 80 pixels, we modify the target by `Math.round(target / gridSize)`, so that we know which grid the box will likely to stop at, then we multiply gridSize to get the distance to that grid.

✱ When you do throw too hard, the div will be caught by the `dragConstraints`.
<SnapToGrid />

```js
dragTransition={{
    power: 0.5,
    timeConstant: 100,
    modifyTarget: (target) => {
        let newTarget = Math.round(target / gridSize) * gridSize
        return newTarget
    }
}}
```

### Example Snap to Corner

<SnapToCorner />

The `onDragEnd()` event is triggered when you release the draggable div. I use it to look at the div’s current position and direction and send it to its nearest corner or the corner it was heading for.

### Tracking position 
I use two Motion values to track the div’s `x` and `y` positions with `get()`.

### Sending the div to the correct corner
When the div’s `x` is less than `0`, I animate it (using animate()) to the left (`-80`), but when `point.x` is more than `0`, I’ll send it to the right (`80`).

And the same happens in the y-direction with top and bottom. So the div will always jump to the nearest corner.

But there’s an exception!

### Tracking velocity
When the div moves in a specific direction at a high enough speed (a velocity over 100), we’ll send it that way instead. This way, you can send it to another corner with just a quick fling. (Which is closer to the ‘intent of the gesture’ — [Apple’s Designing Fluid Interfaces](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/803/).)

To know the div’s current speed and direction, I look at the velocity ✱ values in the event’s PanInfo object.

✱ This contains the pointer’s velocity, but they’ll be more or less the same at that time anyway.



```js
<motion.div
    style={{ x, y }}
    drag
    onDragEnd={(_, info) => {
        let newX
        if (x.get() < 0) {
            newX = -80
            if (info.velocity.x > 100) {
                newX = 80
            }
        } else {
            newX = 80
            if (info.velocity.x < -100) {
                newX = -80
            }
        }

        let newY
        if (y.get() < 0) {
            newY = -160
            if (info.velocity.y > 100) {
                newY = 160
            }
        } else {
            newY = 160
            if (info.velocity.y < -100) {
                newY = -160
            }
        }

        animate(x, newX, { type: 'spring', damping: 20 })
        animate(y, newY, { type: 'spring', damping: 20 })
    }}
/>
```

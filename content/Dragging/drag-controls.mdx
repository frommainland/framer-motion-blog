# Drag Controls 

Usually, when wanting to drag an element, you have to tap on it. But for some use-cases, it makes sense to not have to pick up the draggable element. For instance: when you tap a slider or video scrubber, the (draggable) knob should jump to where you tapped.

## The useDragControls() hook

The `useDragControls()` hook gives you a dragControls object with which you can control a draggable element. Hereâ€™s an example:

<UseDragControlsHook />

This `dragControls` object is a bit like a remote control with which you can `start()` a drag gesture. Here I did this with an `onPointerDown()` event on the background area:

```js
export default function App() {
    const constraintsRef = useRef(null);
    const dragControls = useDragControls();

    return (
        <div
            className="area"
            ref={constraintsRef}
            onPointerDown={(event) => dragControls.start(event)}
        >
            <motion.div
                className="box"
                drag
                dragConstraints={constraintsRef}
                dragControls={dragControls}
            />
        </div>
    );
} 
```

You could also use `onMouseDown()` or `onTouchStart()` but `onPointerDown()` works on both touch and desktop. Whichever event you use, `the start()` function needs its event object for everything to work.

## Cursor Snapping

The `start()` function accepts a snapToCursor option. When set to true, the draggable element will jump to where you clicked or tapped.

<CursorSnapping />

```js
onPointerDown={(event) =>
    dragControls.start(event, { snapToCursor: true })
}
```

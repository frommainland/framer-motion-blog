# Drag Events

## Drag Events
A set of events are triggered when you drag an element.

First, when you pick it up, an `onDragStart()` is emitted.
Then, while dragging, there will be a continuous stream of `onDrag()` events.
And finally, when you release it, there will be an `onDragEnd()`.
These three events receive two objects with more details about the event:

the browser’s native event object (a MouseEvent or TouchEvent), and a PanInfo object provided by Framer Motion.

And there’s a fourth event: `onDirectionLock()`. When you’re using direction lock, it will trigger the moment the element locks to a direction (happens after dragging it 10 points). This event receives the current dragging axis.


## MouseEvent and TouchEvent objects
On the desktop, event will contain a `MouseEvent`, but on a tablet or phone, it will be a `TouchEvent`. They contain different data.

As an example: a `MouseEvent` will contain the pointer’s position in `clientX` and `clientY`. But in a `TouchEvent`, you would have to get that information from a Touch object in its list of touches.


## PanInfo object

> Important to note that these values represent the position of the pointer, not of the element you’re dragging.

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `point.x`      | Horizontal distance of the pointer from the top left of the screen (or viewport)       |
| `point.y`	   | Vertical distance of the pointer from the top left of the screen (or viewport)        |
| `delta.x`      | Horizontal distance traveled by the pointer since the last event call       |
| `delta.y`	   | Vertical distance traveled by the pointer since the last event call        |
| `offset.x`      | Horizontal distance of the pointer from the starting point of the current gesture      |
| `offset.y`	   | Vertical distance of the pointer from the starting point of the current gesture        |
| `velocity.x`      | Current horizontal speed of the pointer       |
| `velocity.y`	   | Current vertical speed of the pointer        |

# Dragging Basic

## Dragging
Make any element draggable with the drag property.

Simply setting a motion element’s drag property to true, which will let you drag it. There’s also a shorthand syntax: You can omit the true and simply set drag:

```js
<motion.div drag />
```
Dragging comes with simulated physics: When you throw the div, it will keep moving with a bit of momentum before coming to a standstill.

## Only horizontally or vertically
Instead of setting drag to true (which enables dragging in all directions), you can also set it to `"x"` or `"y"`; this limits the movement of the motion element to just one direction.

<DraggingBasicDirection />

```js
<motion.div drag="x">
    Horizontal
</motion.div>

<motion.div drag="y">
    Vertical
</motion.div>
```

## Dragging but not moving
Sometimes you need drag a pseudo element to make other element move. If you ever need to do it, here is how to do: no motionvalue in `style`, add an underscore props instead.
<DraggingBasicUndescore />

```js
<motion.div
    drag="x"
    // style={{ x: dragX }}
    _dragX={dragX}
>
```


## Direction lock

Did you notice how in Safari on iOS, when zoomed in on a page, scrolling will stick to one direction? This behavior is called `‘direction lock’` in Framer Motion, and by default, it’s disabled, so you have to switch it on:

```js
<motion.div
    drag
    dragDirectionLock={true}
/>
```

What happens: When you start dragging, the motion div will stay put, and only after you’ve dragged a small distance, it’ll lock to that direction and start moving.

<DraggingBasicDirectionLock />

You can get the direction by 

```js
<motion.div
    drag
    dragDirectionLock
    onDirectionLock={axis => console.log(axis)}
/>
```

## DragPropagation

Try drag around the yellow Box, turn on and off the `dragPropagation` to see the differences. It is set to false by default.

<DraggingBasicDragPropagation />

```js
<motion.div drag="x" dragPropagation />
```

## DragConstraints

Define how far you can drag an element or in which area it should stay.

With the `dragConstraints` property, you can set how far the user can drag an element to the `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` — or, alternatively: you pass `dragConstraints` a reference to an element you want it to stay in.

These constraints don’t impose a hard stop; they have a bit of leeway, some elasticity. There’s a rubber-banding effect (which you can tweak with drag elastic) when you drag the element beyond its constraints.

### Using the area of another element
<DragConstraints />

You can also give dragConstraints a reference to another element, like here the motion div’s parent div. The draggable motion div will then stay within that parent div.
```js
const constraintsRef = useRef(null);
<div ref={constraintsRef}>
    <motion.div
        drag
        dragConstraints={constraintsRef}
    />
</div>
}
```

### Using exact values

You can also use exact values for the `dragConstraints` property.

When using `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`, the constraints will refer to the element’s initial position. So, the value for right stands for ‘this many pixels to the right’.

Note that top and left need negative values. (We’re actually setting the maximum transform values for the div’s `x` and `y` properties.)

<DragConstraintsExactValue />

```js
<motion.div
    drag
    dragConstraints={{
        top: -60,
        right: 70,
        bottom: 60,
        left: -70,
    }}
/>
```

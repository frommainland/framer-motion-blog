# Introduction

## Motion elements

With Framer Motion, you can animate any HTML or SVG element. You turn an element into a motion element by adding motion before it (`<motion.p>`, `<motion.h1>`, `<motion.div>`, etc.).

The motion object you import contains components for every possible HTML and SVG element. So you’ll often use `<motion.div>`… to animate a `<div>`, but there’s also: `<motion.h1>`, `<motion.svg>`, `<motion.path>`, etc.

## The `<motion>` component

These motion elements (actually components) are all inside the `motion` component you import from Framer Motion.

```js
import { motion } from 'framer-motion'
```

The Framer Motion library also contains:

-   some extra components, like `<AnimatePresence>` and `<LayoutGroup>`,
-   utilities, like `useCycle()` and `useAnimate()`,
-   and hooks you can use with Motion values, like `useMotionValue()` and `useTransform()`.

```js
import { motion, AnimatePresence, useCycle, useTransform } from 'framer-motion'
```

## Installation

As mentioned in the Framer Motion docs and on its NPM page, you add Framer Motion to a React project by typing:

```js
npm install framer-motion
```

And then you can import motion and animate, well, everything.

```js
import { motion } from 'framer-motion'
```

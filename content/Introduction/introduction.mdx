# Introduction

## Installation

Add framer motion to react project by this:

```js
npm install framer-motion
```

Then you can import this on the top of your react component file, and start to animate elements.

```js
import { motion } from 'framer-motion'
```

## The `<motion>` component

Adding motion before html element to make to framer motion work, like `motion.div`, `motion.h1`, `motion.svg`, you got the idea.

Other tools in the Framer Motion library includes:

-   some components for more elements or page transitions, like `<AnimatePresence>`
-   some hooks for Motion values, so you can tranform some css values to their mapping values, like `useTransform`
-   some hooks for conditions, like `useInview`

All you need to do is including these along with motion and good to go.

```js
import { motion, AnimatePresence, useTransform, useInview } from 'framer-motion'
```

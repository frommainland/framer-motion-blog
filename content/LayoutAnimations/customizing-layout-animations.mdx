# Customizing Layout Animations

## Transition setting
You can set transition values on a per property basis. (Like, e.g., have only opacity animate slower or faster.) This also works for layout animations.

Take this example. The `motion.div` has a `layout` animation for its `width` and `height` and a common animate for its `backgroundColor`:

<CustomLayoutAnimation />

```js
<motion.div
    layout
    className={styles.item}
    style={{
        width: clicked ? 160 : 120,
        height: clicked ? 160 : 120,
    }}
    animate={{
        backgroundColor: clicked
            ? 'var(--color-accent-yellow)'
            : 'var(--color-surface-200)',
    }}
    onClick={() => setClicked(!clicked)}
    transition={{
        layout: { delay: 1, type: 'spring', stiffness: 150 },
    }}
>
    <motion.div layout className={styles.handle}></motion.div>
</motion.div>
```

## Only animating position or size

`layout="position"`: we only smoothly transition the position-related properties. Size-related properties will transition abruptly.

`layout="size"`: we only smoothly transition the size-related properties. Position-related properties will transition abruptly.

<LayoutValues02 />

### Long text layout animation
This example by Matt Perry shows when youâ€™d want to only animate "position".

The `<motion.div>` containing the text and its parent `<motion.div>` both have a layout property, so they both animate their size and position.

<LayoutValues />

```js
<motion.div layout="position" transition={transition}>
    {isOpen ? long : summary}
</motion.div>
```

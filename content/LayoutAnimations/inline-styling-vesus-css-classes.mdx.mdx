# Inline Styling Versus CSS Classes

You can trigger layout animations by changing a motion element’s inline CSS styling or by giving it a different CSS class. But you might need to make some adjustments when using classes.


## Inline Styling

Nothing fancy, just inline StyleSheet.
```js 
<motion.div
    layout
    className={styles.item}
    style={{
        width: clicked 
        ? itemSize * 1.5 
        : itemSize,
        left: clicked 
        ? 30 
        : `calc(50% - ${itemSize / 2}px)`,
    }}
    onClick={() => setClicked(!clicked)}
/>
```
<InlinevsCSS />

## CSS Class

```js 
export default function App() {
    const [clicked, setClicked] = React.useState(false)

    return (
        <motion.div
            layout
            className={`${clicked ? styles.big : styles.small}`}
            onClick={() => setClicked(!clicked)}
            transition={{ duration: 2 }}
        >
            <motion.p layout transition={{ duration: 2 }}>
                CSS class
            </motion.p>
        </motion.div>
    );
}
```

The border radius and shadow look odd because the `motion.div` instantly switches to its final form and then just resizes.

The reason? These layout animations are FLIP animations that use CSS’s transform property (just like Framer Motion’s `scale`, `x`, `y`, `rotate`, etc. do). This creates [smooth animations](https://motion.mighty.guide/animatable-properties/#the-smoothest-animations) but can have this kind of side-effect. Matt Perry explained on the [Framer blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20210506033002/https://www.framer.com/blog/posts/magic-motion/) how Framer Motion’s version of FLIP works.

### How to fix it
Fixing this is easy, though. You can force the layout animation to also transform `borderRadius` and `boxShadow` by moving those properties to the `motion.div`’s style property

When you use unit other than number for borderRadius, you will NOT get smooth animation either.

# Layout Group

We know `layout` could help individual element to animate smoothly with position, size and its layout. What if this element with `layout` affect its sibling elements? `LayoutGroup` is here to solve this.

The example shows same boxes in a `flex` layout, click one of them will expand its `width`, which will also affect its sibling boxes. If you wrap all the all boxes under `LayoutGroup`, every boxes will animate spontaneously and automatically.

<LayoutGroup01 />

```js
<LayoutGroup>
    <div className={styles.flexbox}>
        {range(10).map((item) => (
            <Box key={item} />
        ))}
    </div>
</LayoutGroup>
```

## Layout Group Naming
I bring the same example from Shared Layout. If you put multiple components with same `layoutId`, the animation will mess up, because `layoutId` is global. To solve this, wrapping component with `LayoutGroup` and unique `id` will put same layoutId under this id naming space. It will make it un-unique.

<LayoutGroupNaming />

```js
<LayoutGroup id="layoutGroupNaming1">
    <SharedLayoutComponent />
</LayoutGroup>
<LayoutGroup id="layoutGroupNaming2">
    <SharedLayoutComponent />
</LayoutGroup>
```

Another better way to solve it is to use `React.useId()` and it will get unique layoutId for every component.

```js
const id = React.useId()
 ///
<motion.div
    className={styles.indicator}
    layoutId={`${id}-indicator`}
/>
```

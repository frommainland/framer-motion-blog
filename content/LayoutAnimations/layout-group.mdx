# Layout Group

We know `layout` could help individual element to animate smoothly with position, size and its layout. What if this element with `layout` affect its sibling elements? `LayoutGroup` is here to solve this.

The example shows same boxes in a `flex` layout, click one of them will expand its `width`, which will also affect its sibling boxes. If you wrap all the all boxes under `LayoutGroup`, every boxes will animate spontaneously and automatically.

<LayoutGroup01 />

```js
<LayoutGroup>
    <div className={styles.flexbox}>
        {range(10).map((item) => (
            <Box key={item} />
        ))}
    </div>
</LayoutGroup>
```


## Put it altogether
<LayoutGroup03 />

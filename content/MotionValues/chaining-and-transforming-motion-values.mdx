# What is a Motion value?

Framer Motion internally uses Motion values for all its animations. Because they live outside React’s render cycle, Framer Motion can start and stop animations without the need for components (or elements with code overrides) to reload. Motion values work independently of React.

However, you can hook into existing Motion values to follow or change animations. This way, you can, for instance, use the position of a draggable element to drive other animations. And the same is possible with the scrolling of a page, with a special useScroll() hook.

## Injecting and Syncing a Motion value

You add a Motion value to a motion element by injecting it through its style property. And hooking into existing Motion values already used by the element (like in the whileTap example below) works the same.
<InjectMotionValue />

## Not a one-way street

This is to show that Motion values flow both ways:

The whileTap on the big motion.div changes the Motion values and makes the smaller motion.divs follow the animation.
But changing a Motion value from the outside also affects the value inside the big motion.div.
This is the set() function, which directly changes the Motion value, but as we’ll see later, you can also animate to a new value.

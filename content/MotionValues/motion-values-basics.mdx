# What is a Motion value?

When you want to pass a value to multiple elements, you can store this value in `useState`, and once state changes, they get synced together. What if the value you want pass is constant changing, like animate element from `0` to `100`. When it's animating, the x value is changing till reaches 100. How to pass it?


## Injecting and Syncing a Motion value

You add a Motion value to a motion element by injecting it through its <span style={{color:'var(--color-accent-yellow)'}}>**style property**</span>. It works like a state in a sense, and you can apply it to other elements.


```js
export default function Example() {
    const scaleMotionValue = useMotionValue(1);
    return (
        <>
            <motion.div
                style={{ scale:scaleMotionValue }}
                whileTap={{ scale: 0.5}}
            />

            {/* Scale */}
            <motion.div style={{ scale:scaleMotionValue }} />
        </>
    )
}
```

If you name motion value same as css style property, you can omit like this:

```js
const scale = useMotionValue(1);
// instead of style ={{ scale: scale }}, you can omit it
<motion.div style={{ scale }} />
``` 

Hover the big div, the rest of small divs will also animate reponsing with the hover.

<InjectMotionValue />

## Not a one-way street

This is to show that Motion values flow both ways:

The `whileHover` on the big motion.div changes the Motion values and makes the smaller divs follow the animation.

You can now hover on the small divs, which will effect on the bigger div too. It won't take effect on other small divs, because the motion value isn't hooked with them.

<SetMotionValue />

```js
// scale value is shared across both divs
const scale = useMotionValue(1);

// big div
<motion.div
    style={{ scale }}
    whileHover={{ scale: 0.75 }}
/>

// small div
<motion.div
	style={{ scale }}
	whileHover={{ scale: 0.25 }}
/>

```

Another way is use `set()` function, which will change it immediately.
```js
<motion.div
	style={{ scale }}
	whileHover={() => scale.set(0.25)}
/>
```

## Displaying a Motion value’s current value
How to make the value visible? You can place the Motion value inside a Motion element or update a `useState()` value with `on()` or `useMotionValueEvent()`.

### Just put it in a motion element.
The simplest way to display a motion value is to place it in a motion element. But for this to work, it must be <span style={{color:'var(--color-accent-yellow)'}}>**the only child of that motion element.**</span>

<ShowMotionValue />
This technique displays the entire Motion value with all its decimals. It doesn't work using `Math.floor` to round it, since motion value is an object.

### Store motion value in state
If you want to manipulate the motion value, you can store it in a state, and work on that state value to a new format.

```js
const scale = useMotionValue(1);

// useState to store
const [scaleState, setScaleState] = React.useState(scale.get());

// useMotionValueEvent to detect the changes and set new state
useMotionValueEvent(scale, "change", (value) => setScaleState(value.toFixed(2) * 100));

// show it in html
<motion.span className={styles.motionNum}>{scaleState}%</motion.span>

```
<MotionValueInState />

If you have multiple motion values in a component, you have to define `useMotionValueEvent` multiple times, which is messy to read. It could be solved by reducing to one state, and every time the state changes, it retrigger `get()` function.

```js
export default function Example() {
    const rotate = useMotionValue(0);
    const scale = useMotionValue(1);
    const backgroundColor = useMotionValue("#fa2");

    const [someState, setSomeState] = useState(0);

    useMotionValueEvent(rotate, "change", (value) => setSomeState(value));

    return (
        <>
            <p>{`${Math.floor(rotate.get())}°`}</p>
            <p>{`${Math.floor(scale.get() * 100)}%`}</p>
            <p>{backgroundColor.get()}</p>
        </>
    );
}
```

`useMotionValueEvent` subscribe to a motion value change event all the time. Once the state changes, it causes react repaint which `get()` get the lastest value.

## Motion Value onDrag case

### Example with useState
In this example, the handle position is set in a `const [handleX, setHandleX] = React.useState(0)`, when you drag it, the two panels behind it will reponse to the drag. If you throw the handle, these two panels' width won't change. 

The reason is after releasing the mouse, the `onDrag` event won't be triggered, so there will be no value updates from `handleX`.

When you drag again, the `onDrag` event will pick data again, recalculate the widths for both panels. 

<UseStateSlider />

### Example with MotionValue

You can solve the tracking data issue by linking handle's `x` position with `onDrag` event. The `x` value is monitored constantly and stored in `motionValue`, the widths of two panels can be calculated by value changes of `x`. Also `x` changes can be used to get new values like `scale`.


<MotionValueSlider />

```js
const x = useMotionValue(0)
//width changes
const leftPanelWidth = useTransform(() => width / 2 + x.get())
const rightPanelWidth = useTransform(() => width / 2 - x.get())
// scale changes
const leftScale = useTransform(x, [-width / 2, 0, width / 2], [0.5, 1, 2])
const rightScale = useTransform(x, [-width / 2, 0, width / 2], [2, 1, 0.5])
```

Another mysterious thing is when you `console.log('redraw')` in a component using Motion Value, it appear only once (or twice). This is because Motion values handle the animation without requiring React to do a redraw.

# Transform motion value by useSpring
Similiar as `useTransform()`, `useSpring()` also creates motion values with a spring animation.

You can create it like:

```js
const x = useSpring(0)
```

Or you can convert values from `useTransform()` like

```js
const x = useTransform(0)
const xSpring = useSpring(x)
```

Know that `useSpring()` only accepts default spring settings (so no duration-based spring settings like duration and bounce).

```js
const x = useSpring(scrollYProgress, {
    stiffness: 100,
    damping: 30,
    restDelta: 0.001
})
```

## Draggable Item
This example is originally from [codesandbox â†—](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/framer-motion-usespring-example-0ctgom?file=/src/index.tsx), and I made some tweaks.

The solution is manage each div's spring config based on the distance to the dragged div. So does the scale. I have not figured out using motion value as scale to manipulate the animation and calculate the right mouse positon after `onDragEnd`.
```js
const rowDif = (activeItem.x - row) ** 2
const columnDif = (activeItem.y - column) ** 2
const dis = Math.sqrt(rowDif + columnDif)

const springConfig = {
    stiffness: Math.max(1000 - dis * 120, 0),
    damping: 20 + dis * 5,
}
```

# SVG Path

## Path Basic

An SVG contains its own type of elements like, e.g., Circle, Line, Image, Path, different Gradients, and Filters. And you can animate all of them.

### A simple curve
Every SVG path has a d attribute: a string that describes its shape. The letters in that string are drawing commands, and the numbers are values passed to those commands.

```js
<motion.path
    d="M 24 24 C 96 24 96 96 96 96"
    stroke="var(--color-accent-green)"
    strokeWidth={10}
    strokeLinecap="round"
    fill="transparent"
/>
```
The commands in this path’s `d` are:

`M 24 24` — Move to a point 24 pixels from the left and 24 from the top.
The list of commands always starts with an M. You need to place the pen somewhere on the paper before drawing a line.

`C 96 24 96 96` — Add control point for a cubic Bézier curve at x-position 96 and y-position 24 for point(24,24), which is the first point. Add another control point for point(96,96), which is the last point
A cubic Bézier curve has two control point that defines the slope for both its start and end points.

`96 96` — Draw the next point, 96 pixels from the left and top.

This can be visualized in this [site](https://yqnn.github.io/svg-path-editor/), powerful stuff.


### The path’s style

- `stroke` — Color of the path’s stroke.
- `strokeWidth` — The stroke’s width in pixels.
- `strokeLinecap` — How the path’s endings should look.
- `fill` — The path’s fill color. We don’t want the default "black", so we make it "transparent".


## Animating the curve
Morphing the path’s shape is easy: You animate to another `d` string with a similar set of values. Same as animate html elements.

```js
<motion.path
    d="M 24 24 C 96 24 96 96 96 96"
    animate={{ d: 'M 96 96 C 58 58 24 96 24 96' }}
    transition={{
        repeat: Infinity,
        repeatType: 'mirror',
        ease: 'easeInOut',
        duration: 3,
    }}
/>
```
<SVGPathBasic />

## Keyframes
Keyframes are also possible. Here the `<motion.path>` doesn’t need a `d` attribute because a keyframe animation uses its first keyframe as the from value.

```js
<motion.path
    animate={{ 
        d: [
		'M 24 24 C 96 24 96 96 96 96',
		'M 96 96 C 58 58 24 96 24 96',
		'M 96 96 C 58 58 24 23 24 23',
		'M 24 96 C 24 23 96 23 96 23',
		'M 24 24 C 96 24 96 96 96 96',
        ]
    }}
/>
```

### Paths must be similar
This is the limitation when animating paths: you can only animate between paths with the same number of commands and same kind of commands. You can’t animate, for instance, from a quadratic Bézier curve (Q) to a cubic one (C), or to an arc curve (A).

<SVGPathKeyframe />


## Bending a straight line
To get around this limitation, you can add extra points or curves. Here’s an example of how a straight line with an added curve can be animated to an arc.

You can draw arc first in any vector graphic apps, and use that arc and bend it to a line. Don't remove the control handles. 
<SVGLine2Circle />


## More example
This is from [Matt](https://codesandbox.io/s/mx2rw?file=/src/Example.jsx). Smart to just hide the second bar during animation, instead of morphing into X.

```js
<motion.path
    stroke="var(--color-text-100)"
    animate={{
        d: open ? 'M 40 40 L 80 80' : 'M 35 40 L 85 40',
    }}
    strokeWidth={10}
    strokeLinecap="round"
    fill="transparent"
/>
<motion.path
    d="M 35 60 H 85"
    stroke="var(--color-text-100)"
    animate={{ opacity: open ? 0 : 1 }}
    transition={{ duration: 0.1 }}
    strokeWidth={10}
    strokeLinecap="round"
    fill="transparent"
/>
<motion.path
    animate={{
        d: open ? 'M 40 80 L 80 40' : 'M 35 80 L 85 80',
    }}
    stroke="var(--color-text-100)"
    strokeWidth={10}
    strokeLinecap="round"
    fill="transparent"
/>
```

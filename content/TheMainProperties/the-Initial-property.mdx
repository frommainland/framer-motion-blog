# Initial

## Another way of setting the starting state

Sometimes, setting `initial` is a quick way of animating elements. For the example on the left, if I want to animating an element from bottom to center, I need its `y` position as start point, and have to figure out the distance to center. While if I use flex to position the div in the `animate` config, then I only need to assign `y` value for the start point.

Consider `initial` is another way of writing css for element's original state, and it will override the css, so `animate` is always the end state of initial instead of css.

On the right, the example use `intial` to shrink the div to `0` first, so I don't have to calculate the layout change of scale animation.

```js
// left example with inital y
;<motion.div
	className={styles.item}
	initial={{ y: 200, scale: 0.5 }}
	animate={{ y: 0, scale: 1 }}
	transition={{
		duration: 1,
	}}
></motion.div>

// right example with inital scaleY
{
	range(3).map((item) => {
		return (
			<motion.div
				className={styles.singleStripe}
				key={item}
				initial={{ scaleY: 0, originY: 1 }}
				animate={{ scaleY: 1 }}
				transition={{
					delay: 0.4 * item,
					duration: 0.4,
				}}
			></motion.div>
		)
	})
}
```

<Initial />

### Suppressing initial animations

> If a motion component is set to `initial={false}`, it'll start in the state defined in animate. But sometimes, for instance a chatbox or a slideshow, we only want to animate in new components, that are added after the initial render. By setting `initial={false}` on `AnimatePresence`, components present when `AnimatePresence` first loads will start in their animate state. Only components that enter after this initial render will animate in.

This is official doc explanation from framer motion, and the `inital={false}` is mostly used in `AnimatePresence`, so I will show example in there.

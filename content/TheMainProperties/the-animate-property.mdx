# The Animate Property

## Basic animation

The easiest way to animate an element, is to set some values on `animate`.

```js
export function Example() {
	return (
		<Center>
			<motion.div
				style={{
					width: 150,
					height: 150,
					borderRadius: 30,
					backgroundColor: '#fff',
					position: 'absolute',
				}}
				animate={{
					left: 10,
					top: 10,
					scale: 0.5,
					rotate: 45,
					backgroundColor: '#ffd700',
				}}
			/>
		</Center>
	)
}
```

> customized code example

Whenever you give `animate` new values, the `motion.div` will animate to those values.

Now, this animation happens immediately, the moment the element becomes visible. But we‚Äôll look at how you can trigger it with an event.

Obviously, there‚Äôs more code here because I‚Äôve also had so set visual and positioning properties. So in upcoming examples, I‚Äôll often only show the animation code, like this:

```js
export function Example() {
	return (
		<Center>
			<motion.div
				animate={{
					left: 10,
					top: 10,
					scale: 0.5,
					rotate: 45,
					backgroundColor: '#ffd700',
				}}
			/>
		</Center>
	)
}
```

But you can always find the complete code in the CodeSandbox.

## Transform properties

Above I used the `left` and `top` properties to animate the div‚Äôs position, but it‚Äôs actually better to use `x` and `y` for this. With these, what they call, [transform](https://motion.mighty.guide/animatable-properties/#transform) properties, animations will run [smoother](https://motion.mighty.guide/animatable-properties/#the-smoothest-animations) (GPU accelerated).

They also have the advantage of starting from zero, so moving an element 10 points to the right is as simple as `x: 10`. Other GPU-accelerated transform properties are: `scale`, `scaleX`, `scaleY`, `rotate`, `rotateX`, `rotateY`, `skewX`, and `skewY`.

```js
export function Example() {
	return (
		<motion.div animate={{ scaleY: 0.5, scaleX: 2, skewX: -6, y: -120 }} />
	)
}
```

## Transform origin

These transforms (scaling, rotating, and skewing) will happen from the element‚Äôs transformation origin. By default, this is the center, but you can change that.

Here I placed the `originY` at the top of the div so that the (x-axis) rotation happens with that edge as the center point.

```js
export function Example() {
	return (
		<div>
			<motion.div
				style={{
					width: 150,
					height: 150,
					borderRadius: 30,
					backgroundColor: '#fff',
					originY: 0,
				}}
				animate={{ rotateX: 360 }}
			/>
		</div>
	)
}
```

By the way, I applied some `perspective` to its parent div to make the animation look three-dimensional:

```js
export function Example() {
	return (
		<div
			style={{
				width: '100%',
				height: '100%',
				display: 'flex',
				placeItems: 'center',
				placeContent: 'center',
				perspective: 600,
			}}
		>
			<motion.div
				style={{
					width: 150,
					height: 150,
					borderRadius: 30,
					backgroundColor: '#fff',
					originY: 0,
				}}
				animate={{ rotateX: 360 }}
			/>
		</div>
	)
}
```

## color

Just like you can change a div‚Äôs `backgroundColor`, you can also animate it. As always, you write the color as a text string, in any of these [CSS color formats](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/background-color):

-   Hex Code ‚Äî `#00ff00`
-   Websafe Hex Code ‚Äî `‚Äú#0f0‚Äù`
-   RGB Decimal ‚Äî `‚Äúrgb(0, 255, 0)‚Äù`
-   RGBA Decimal ‚Äî `‚Äúrgba(0, 255, 0, 1)‚Äù` (the last value is ‚Äòalpha‚Äô)
-   Hue Saturation Lightness ‚Äî `‚Äúhsl(120, 100%, 50%)‚Äù`
-   Hue Saturation Lightness Alpha ‚Äî `‚Äúhsla(120, 100%, 50%, 1)‚Äù`

```js
export function Example() {
	return (
		<div>
			<motion.div animate={{ backgroundColor: '#ff6347' }} />
			<motion.div animate={{ backgroundColor: 'hsl(290, 50%, 60%)' }} />
			<motion.div
				animate={{ backgroundColor: 'rgba(153, 204, 102, 0.8)' }}
			/>
		</div>
	)
}
```

> customized code example

You can also animate between different color formats, like from a HEX to an RGB value.

> **Pro tip**: You can‚Äôt animate with [CSS named colors](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp) like, e.g., ==‚ÄúTomato‚Äù==.

## Complex values

Some CSS values are more complex. For example, a CSS `boxShadow` is also written as a string, but this string can contain the shadow‚Äôs x- and y-offset, blur, spread, and color.

You can animate all these values simultaneously if you stick to one kind of notation. Take this example:

```js
export function Example() {
	return (
		<motion.div
			style={{
				width: 150,
				height: 150,
				borderRadius: 30,
				backgroundColor: '#fff',
				// Initial shadow
				boxShadow: '0px -300px 80px 100px rgba(255, 255, 255, .3)',
			}}
			initial={{ backgroundColor: '#fff' }}
			animate={{
				backgroundColor: '#08f',
				// Animation
				boxShadow: '0px 0px 80px 30px #fff',
			}}
		/>
	)
}
```

Its initial shadow (set on style) is:

```
"0px -300px 80px 100px rgba(255, 255, 255, .3)"
```

Which stands for:

`0px` ‚Äî x-offset
`-300px` ‚Äî y-offset
`80px` ‚Äî blur radius
`100px` ‚Äî spread,
and `rgba(255, 255, 255, .3)` as the color.

‚Ä¶ so I had to animate to a shadow defined with the same five values:

```
"0px 0px 80px 30px #fff"
```

Animating to a shadow written in the shorter ‚Äòjust x- and y-offset and color‚Äô form (also [possible in CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow#Syntax) would not work.

```
"0px 0px #ffffff"
```

## Adding state

Of course, you don‚Äôt always have to animate an element when it appears. Whatever you pass to `animate` can be saved in a `useState()` so that you can change it.

### example 1

Here‚Äôs an additive animation. `45` is added to the `degrees` state every time you tap, making the div rotate.

```js
export function Example() {
	const [degrees, setDegrees] = useState(0)

	function add45() {
		setDegrees(degrees + 45)
	}

	return <motion.div animate={{ rotate: degrees }} onTap={add45} />
}
```

> code example

### example 2

n this second example, the motion div will rotate when you pan it (panning is like dragging, but without the div going anywhere üòâ).

Framer Motion‚Äôs `onPan()` event returns two things: a common MouseEvent (or TouchEvent) object and a special `PanInfo` object that contains (among other things) a `delta` of points that the pointer moved since the last event.

I named that second object info, so the distance traveled since the last time `onPan()` was called will be in `info.delta.x`.

```js
export function Example() {
	const [degrees, setDegrees] = useState(0)

	return (
		<motion.div
			animate={{ rotate: degrees }}
			onPan={(_, info) => setDegrees(degrees + info.delta.x)}
		>
			{Math.round(degrees)}
		</motion.div>
	)
}
```

This `onPan()` event is called continuously, so `delta.x` will contain small values, like `1` point, another point, `-1` point when panning to the left, or often: `0` points. Every time `onPan()` is called, that delta is added to the current number of `degrees` with `setDegrees()`. Thus, when you pan to the right, the div rotates clockwise, and when panning left, counterclockwise.

(JavaScript‚Äôs `Math.round()` function converts the decimal value of `degrees` to an integer.)

## Multiple properties

You don‚Äôt have to create an useState() for every property you want to animate, you can also put a set of properties in an object (here, it contains values for both scale and rotate).

```js
export function Example() {
	const [animate, setAnimate] = useState({ scale: 1, rotate: 0 })

	return (
		<motion.div
			animate={animate}
			onTapStart={() => setAnimate({ scale: 1.25, rotate: 90 })}
			onTap={() => setAnimate({ scale: 1, rotate: 0 })}
		/>
	)
}
```

## Using `useState()` purely for‚Ä¶ state

In the previous examples, we‚Äôve used `useState()` to animate just one property (`scale`) or an object that contains multiple properties (`scale` and `rotate`).

But you can use `useState()` to keep track of just the state. Meaning something like ‚ÄùIs the switch on or off?‚Äù or, in the following example, ‚ÄúIs the box dragged right now?‚Äù

> code example

Here we‚Äôre switching between two states: dragging or not, yes or no, so we can use a simple Boolean for this.

```js
export function Example() {
	const [dragging, setDragging] = useState(false)

	return (
		<motion.div
			animate={{ backgroundColor: dragging ? '#a0f' : '#04f' }}
			transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
		>
			<motion.div
				drag
				dragConstraints={{
					top: -140,
					right: 140,
					bottom: 140,
					left: -140,
				}}
				animate={{ scale: dragging ? 1 : 0.8 }}
				onDragStart={() => setDragging(true)}
				onDragEnd={() => setDragging(false)}
			/>
		</motion.div>
	)
}
```

The parent‚Äôs `backgroundColor` is now set inline, with a ternary operator (a concise way of writing an `if‚Ä¶else` conditional). When `dragging` is true, it will animate to the first color (`‚Äú#a0f‚Äù`), and when not, it animates to the second color (`‚Äú#04f‚Äù`).

And the same happens with the draggable div‚Äôs `scale`: when `dragging` is `true`, it will be `1`, and when `false`, it‚Äôll be the smaller `0.8`.

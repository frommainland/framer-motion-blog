# The Transition Property

## Transition options

The options you can play with `transition` are: `duration`, `type`, `ease`, `repeat`, `deplay`, `repeatDelay`. When you `animate` element, the default `duration` is `0.3`, the `type` is `'spring'`.

If you want this default animation, you don't have to specified these options in `transition`, just write down the effect like `animate={{scale: 2}}`.

## duration

You can put only **positive** number for the duration. The rule of thumb for the length of duration is:

-   for hover, fading and so on, `duration` should be `0.1` ~ `0.2`.
-   for page move, grabbing user attention and so on, `duration` should be `0.3` ~ `0.5`.
-   for small element animating small changes should be faster.
-   for large element animating complex changes should be slower.
-   small element travels more than large element in the same animation duration.

## ease

### spring

The default ease is `'spring'`, which is good for stimulation of physical world. It is like a ball attached to spring and drop it. The animation is bouncy, it will swing back and forth before reach stop position.

Here are the default values:

```js
export function Example() {
	return (
		<motion.div
			animate={{ scale: 200 }}
			transition={{
				type: 'spring',
				stiffness: 100,
				damping: 10,
				mass: 1,
				velocity: 0,
				restDelta: 0.01,
				restSpeed: 0.01,
			}}
		/>
	)
}
```

You can also use duration-based spring animation, instead of twicking all the settings above, you can simply play with `duration` and `bounce` to achieve similar effect.

```js
export function Example() {
	return (
		<motion.divz
			animate={{ scale: 200 }}
			transition={{
				type: 'spring',
				duration: 0.8,
				bounce: 0.25,
			}}
		/>
	)
}
```

Here is quick view of how this config values works on the element, change the sliders to see how bouncy it will be, and click the heart to restart the animation.

### spring custome template
It is greate to tweak the config to get exact what we feel like, while sometimes we don't. A few template would save a lot of time getting work done.

### tween

`'tween'` is the same as CSS transitions, the build-in easing curves are:

| Syntax                   | Description                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ease: "linear"`         | The animation will move at a constant speed.                             |
| `ease: "easeIn"`         | Starts slowly and picks up speed. Like a car driving off.                |
| `ease: "easeOut"`        | Slows down before stopping, as if the car ran out of gas.                |
| `ease: "easeInOut"`      | Picks up speed at the start and slows down at the end.                   |
| `ease: "circIn"`         | An ease-in with a circular curve.                                        |
| `ease: "circOut"`        | An ease-out with a circular curve.                                       |
| `ease: "circInOut"`      | An ease-in-out with a circular curve.                                    |
| `ease: "backIn"`         | An ease-in that pulls back a bit before moving forward.                  |
| `ease: "backOut"`        | An ease-out that overshoots a bit.                                       |
| `ease: "backInOut"`      | An ease-in-out pulls back at the start and also overshoots its endpoint. |
| `ease: "anticipate"`     | Just like a back-in-out but without the overshoot at the end.            |
| `ease: [1,-0.65,0,1.25]` | A custom Bézier curve.                                                   |

### inertia

The inertia behavior type applies physics such as friction or gravity to specified elements. It only decelerates the element's speed like sport curling. There is only setting: `velocity`. The higher `velocity` is, the more the output is. You can't set the `duration` for `inertia` animation, unlike `spring` animation.

Note, even I just animate the `y` to `1`, it will ignore it, the animate distance(output) is only decided by `velocity`.

```js
export function Example() {
	return (
		<motion.div
			animate={{
				y: 1,
			}}
			transition={{
				type: 'inertia',
				velocity: 100,
			}}
		></motion.div>
	)
}
```

## repeat

Add a `repeat` value to make an animation run more than once. For instance, with a repeat of `2`, the animation will run thrice (two extra after the initial one).

Or you set it to `Infinity` and have it repeat till the end of time.

## delay

With `delay`, you add a pause before the start of the animation (also in seconds). It will only delay the beginning of the initial animation and not insert pauses between the repetitions.

`delay` also can be dynamic value, you can use `map` function to have more control about the `delay` value. Something like:

```js
transition={{
	delay: 1 * index,
    duration: 0.5,
}}
```

In the example below, you can use cubic-bezier curve to make the `delay` more organic, by caculating the `y` position to get `x` value, see more details [bezier-easing ↗](https://github.com/gre/bezier-easing)

<DelayExample />

<DelayMix />

## repeatDelay

You can also add a pause between the repetitions of a repeat, with another setting: `repeatDelay`. It will NOT work if you conside moving element from point A to B and use `repeatType: reverse` to move element from point B to A as a whole. It will see the example as two seperate animation, so it will delay twice.

## repeatType

Your animation can repeat in a few different ways. The default repeatType (in the former examples) is "loop": the animation will just start over. The other two, "mirror" and "reverse", make it go back and forth.
| Syntax | Description |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `loop` | The default type. The animation simply runs again. |
| `mirror` | Flips the from and to values. The animation runs forward, backward, then forward again, etc. (This was called flip in earlier versions.) |
| `reverse` | Does the same but also reverses the animation curve. So when the animation starts slowly, the reverse animation will end slowly. |

The example below using `ease: easeIn`, so when the `repeatType:reverse`, the second half animation: shrinking all element back, will use `ease: easeOut`. Interesting article about[ Reversing an Easing Curve ↗](https://css-tricks.com/reversing-an-easing-curve/)

<RepeatMix />

## transition per properties

The transition property defines how all the properties will animate. However, you can assign distinct values for one or more properties by assigning new values inside the `transition` like this:

```js
export function Example() {
	return (
		<motion.div
			animate={{
				x: 100,
				y: 200,
			}}
			transition={{
				duration: 1,
				repeat: Infinity,
				ease: easeIn,
				repeatType: 'reverse',
				y: {
					delay: 1,
					duration: 2,
					ease: easeOut,
				},
			}}
		/>
	)
}
```

It turns out when you apply diffrent easing curves on `x` and `y` value, the element will go straight to the end point, instead the path will bend. Try the example below to see how easings effect the path.

## transition reset

Go try hover the two rotate divs, you will see without transition reset, the `whileHover` animation will carry over to `rotate` animation, because the transition is shared between `animate` and `whileHover`.

<TransitionReset />

To solve this, you have to specify `transition` for `animate`, so the 'globale' transition is always be default transition. I don't specify `transition` for `whileHover`, so `transition` for `whileHover` is default, not null.

```js
// without reset transition
export function Example() {
	return (
		<motion.div
			animate={{
				rotate: 360,
			}}
			transition={{
				duration: 2,
				repeat: Infinity,
			}}
			whileHover={{
				backgroundColor: 'var(--color-accent-yellow)',
				scale: 1.2,
			}}
		/>
	)
}

// with reset transition
export function Example() {
	return (
		<motion.div
			animate={{
				rotate: 360,
				transition: {
					duration: 2,
					repeat: Infinity,
				},
			}}
			whileHover={{
				backgroundColor: 'var(--color-accent-yellow)',
				scale: 1.2,
			}}
		/>
	)
}
```

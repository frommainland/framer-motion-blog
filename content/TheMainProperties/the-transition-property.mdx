# The Transition Property

## Transition options

The options you can play with `transition` are: `duration`, `type`, `ease`, `repeat`, `deplay`, `repeatDelay`. When you `animate` element, the default `duration` is `0.3`, the `type` is `'spring'`.

If you want this default animation, you don't have to specified these options in `transition`, just write down the effect like `animate={{scale: 2}}`.

## duration

You can put only **positive** number for the duration. The rule of thumb for the length of duration is:

-   for hover, fading and so on, `duration` should be `0.1` ~ `0.2`.
-   for page move, grabbing user attention and so on, `duration` should be `0.3` ~ `0.5`.
-   for small element animating small changes should be faster.
-   for large element animating complex changes should be slower.
-   small element travels more than large element in the same animation duration.

## ease

### spring

The default ease is `'spring'`, which is good for stimulation of physical world. It is like a ball attached to spring and drop it. The animation is bouncy, it will swing back and forth before reach stop position.

### tween

`'tween'` is the same as CSS transitions,


<div id='easeTween' >
| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `ease: "linear"`      | The animation will move at a constant speed.       |
| `ease: "easeIn"` | Starts slowly and picks up speed. Like a car driving off. |
|`ease: "easeOut"` | Slows down before stopping, as if the car ran out of gas. |
| `ease: "easeInOut"` | Picks up speed at the start and slows down at the end. |
| `ease: "circIn"` | An ease-in with a circular curve. |
| `ease: "circOut"` | An ease-out with a circular curve. |
| `ease: "circInOut"` | An ease-in-out with a circular curve. |
| `ease: "backIn"` | An ease-in that pulls back a bit before moving forward. |
| `ease: "backOut"` | An ease-out that overshoots a bit. |
| `ease: "backInOut"` | An ease-in-out pulls back at the start and also overshoots its endpoint. |
| `ease: "anticipate"` | Just like a back-in-out but without the overshoot at the end. |
| `ease: [1,-0.65, 0, 1.25]` | A custom BÃ©zier curve. |
